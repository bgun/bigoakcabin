		<div class="attraction">
			<a href="http://www.adventuresinarkansas.com/?p=103">Twin Falls</a><br />
			<p>How this got its name, I don't know: it's a triple falls!  Rumor has it that the stream above the cliff broke into two waterfalls for years, but a new section of rock broke loose years after the falls was named and it became a triple falls � just never got re-named.  From Jasper, go west on Hwy 74, turn right at the Camp Orr sig and follow the steep dirt road to the bottom of the valley.  Not advisable to drive down in wet conditions unless you have a 4-wheel drive.  Ordinary cars can make it back up from the valley if the road is dry.  Look for the sign on the left at the bottom saying "Twin Falls".  The walking trail is less than �" mile to the falls.  </p>
